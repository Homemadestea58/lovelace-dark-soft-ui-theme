# Lovelace Soft UI dark theme
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)  
Home Assistant dark theme, built on from @JuanMTech, using style boilerplates from @thomasloven and @N-L1.
This theme depends on [`card-mod`](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) for the soft-ui styling.

*Note: I've changed the theme so the header's background is black instead of purple since this screenshot was taken.*
